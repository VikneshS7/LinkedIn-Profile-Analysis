LinkedIn Profile Data Analysis

To start off with this project we have to get a dataset of our own activities on LinkedIn. This is possible with LinkedIn's option for downloading our personal data in an 
archived format. The steps are:-

1. Go to Settings & Privacy
2. Select Data Privacy Tab
3. Click on "Get a Copy of your Data" option
4. Download the options with respect to your choice and click on request
5. Our data will be ready as a downloadable Zip file within 24 Hours

The analysis of the profile is done with the help of Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Power BI Desktop. Data quality is checked and cleaned for duplicate or null values using 
Excel and then it is loaded into Power BI. The important metrics for a LinkedIn profile anlysis are Connections, Messages and Companies Followed. Hence those are created 
using calculated measures and used in the visualizations.
